I18nExt
=======

This plugin changes 2 features to use i18n in better manner.

(1) It changes f.label to use i18n for it's default text.

(2) It changes error_messages_for to use i18n with the better key.
The first point; it uses object's class information as a i18n key instead of the first parameter.
The second point; it uses 'some_model' key pattern instead of 'some model' pattern, same as the human_name method.
